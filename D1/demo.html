    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <pre><p><ul type = "square"><li>A programming language is a formal system of instructions used by humans to communicate with computers and create software, websites, applications, and more.</li>
    <li>Like human languages, each has its own unique syntax (rules) and structure, enabling developers to translate human logic and algorithms into machine-executable code.</li></ul></p></pre>
    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul type = "circle">
        <li>Purpose:
            The primary function of a programming language is to provide a precise and structured way to tell a computer what tasks to perform to solve a problem. Computers operate using binary code (1s and 0s), which is difficult for humans to write; programming languages bridge this gap by using human-readable words and symbols that are later translated into binary.</li>
        <li>Translation: Code written in a programming language (source code) must be translated into machine code before a computer's CPU can execute it.<br> This is done by a:<br>
        <ul type  = disc>
            <li>Compiler: Translates the entire source code into machine code before the program runs (e.g., C, C++).</li>
        <li>Interpreter: Translates and executes the code line by line at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript). </li>
        </ul></li>
